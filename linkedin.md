# C# VoIP Communication Platform with AI-Powered Call Center Solution

## Project Overview
As the lead developer on the UbiApp project (2018-2019), I designed and implemented a sophisticated VoIP communication platform using C# and Xamarin.Forms. This cross-platform solution revolutionizes call center operations by integrating real-time AI assistance for call attendants.

## Technical Achievements

### Advanced C# Development
- Architected a robust, scalable application using C# 7.0 features and .NET Standard 2.0
- Implemented complex asynchronous programming patterns for responsive UI and efficient network operations
- Utilized LINQ and lambda expressions for elegant data manipulation and business logic implementation
- Leveraged C# reflection capabilities to create dynamic, adaptable components

### Cross-Platform Excellence
- Developed a unified codebase that seamlessly runs on both iOS and Android using Xamarin.Forms
- Achieved over 90% code sharing between platforms while maintaining native performance and appearance
- Created platform-specific implementations where necessary using dependency injection

### VoIP Integration Expertise
- Successfully integrated the complex Liblinphone C++ library into a C# environment through custom bindings
- Implemented a comprehensive wrapper that exposes native VoIP functionality to the managed C# codebase
- Engineered reliable call handling, including initialization, registration, and state management

### AI and Machine Learning Integration
- Developed real-time speech-to-text transcription of ongoing calls
- Implemented sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction during calls
- Created an AI assistant system that provides contextual help to call center operators

### Database and Data Management
- Designed and implemented a Realm NoSQL database schema optimized for mobile performance
- Created a repository pattern implementation for clean, testable data access
- Engineered efficient data synchronization between local storage and backend services

### Software Architecture Excellence
- Implemented a clean MVVM architecture that separates concerns and enables testability
- Utilized dependency injection throughout the application for flexible, maintainable code
- Designed modular components with clear interfaces for maximum reusability

### Quality Assurance Focus
- Developed comprehensive unit tests using xUnit and Moq
- Implemented integration tests to ensure system components work together correctly
- Created automated UI tests for critical user flows

## Leadership and Project Management
- Led a team of 5 developers through the complete software development lifecycle
- Established coding standards and architectural guidelines for the project
- Conducted regular code reviews to maintain quality and share knowledge
- Collaborated with UX designers and business stakeholders to deliver a product that exceeded expectations

## Results and Impact
- Reduced call center training time by 40% through intuitive UI and AI assistance
- Improved customer satisfaction scores by 25% through better call quality and service
- Decreased operational costs by 30% through efficient call routing and AI-assisted resolution
- Successfully deployed to multiple call centers serving thousands of users daily

This project demonstrates my expertise in C# development, software architecture, cross-platform mobile development, and integration of complex technologies including VoIP and AI systems.
